# EP2 VO Code

This repo contains the code presented at the seminars of the course Einf√ºhrung in die Programmierung 2 at the TU Wien.
Since our Prof submits the code in a complicated way, I made this repo to do it much simpler. I will update it as soon as
the new chunks are published. 
### Be advised: This is an IntelliJ based project.
### How to install?
Simple. Just clone the repo and enjoy it. If you like GUI, open it with IntelliJ's Check Out From Version Control. But
Terminal is just fine as well.
